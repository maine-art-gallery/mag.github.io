					There was an air of excitement during the early 2020 meetings of the Maine Art Gallery Board of Directors. Plans for summer exhibits were well under way and we were developing plans for fundraising and promotion. Wendy Ross and Tom Eichler had agreed to head up the fundraising. Chris Hopf-Lovette was supervising ad production and placement, and John Gable, an artist who would be participating in the Contemporary Realism show met with us to share his ideas about attracting more visitors to the gallery.
					<br>
					<br>

					And then, in the latter part of March, the Coronavirus brought in-person activities to a halt. The gallery would have to remain shuttered for the season. But thanks to the initiative and technical skills of our webmaster, Elizabeth Campbell, the shows have gone ahead as virtual online exhibits. With her help we are also taking this opportunity to reach out and invite more visitors to our website, <a href="https://www.maineartgallerywiscasset.org/join"> maineartgallerywiscasset.org.</a>
					<br>
					<br>

					The virus didn’t prevent Tom and Wendy from moving ahead with the fundraising campaign, either. They have raised $10,178 so far. Our goal is to raise $25,000 in order to hire a part-time gallery manager/development director for eight hours per day, two days per week.
					<br>
					<br>

					We invite you to visit the <a href="https://www.maineartgallerywiscasset.org/join"> Maine Art Gallery</a> site to view our exhibits, keep up with our activities, and make a donation online to help us reach our goal of funding a part-time staff member.

						Contemporary realism is the focus of our current online exhibit, where seven artists portray glimpses of their reality. The show, originally scheduled to be seen in the gallery at this time, has been rescheduled to 2021 due to the Coronavirus. However, one can get a preview of the show <a href="https://www.maineartgallerywiscasset.org/contemporary-realism-preview">here</a>. The images will be available for viewing through October 5, 2020.
						<br>
						<br>

						“I hope the viewers will get as much enjoyment from the show as I did in selection the artists,” said Elaine Pew, curator of the exhibit. “Each of them presents their vision of reality in their own unique way.”
						<br>
						<br>

						Carolyn Gabbe paints in the tradition of the Old Masters of the Renaissance. 
						<br>
						<br>

						Melissa Greene expresses a poetic vision of the ways that women and animals interact with the natural world on her exquisite pots. 
						<br>
						<br>

						Winslow Meyers is very precise in defining his space with a lyrical, soothing palette. 
						<br>
						<br>

						Mat O’Donnell’s work has an edge to it. He asks the viewer to complete the story on his canvas. 
						<br>
						<br>

						Daphne Pulsifer uses classical sculptural techniques to render her bronzes of figures and animals.
						<br> 
						<br>

						Douglas Smith celebrates life through paintings that convey a sense of time and place and quality of light. 
						<br>
						<br>

						Susan Tobey White presents a series of paintings that tell the story of lobster women at work.
